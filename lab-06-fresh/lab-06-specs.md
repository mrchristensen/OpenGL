# Lab 6: Transformation Hierarchies with OpenGL
In this lab, you will continue to use the OpenGL package and build off your completed code for lab 5.  Now that you are familiar with OpenGL and can setup the initial 3D projection, you can begin using some of the more powerful features.

In class, we have talked about the power of using tranformations in designing, manipulating, and moving 3D models.  In this lab, you will use transformation hierarchies to build a street of houses. Additionally, you will use tranformation hierarchies to make animation of a car driving down the street, with wheels turning.

## User Interface
The user interface should be identical to the one implemented in Lab 5.  The same keys should cause the same movements.  The only difference is that the H key returns to home position, but it also resets the time (see the Time section).
